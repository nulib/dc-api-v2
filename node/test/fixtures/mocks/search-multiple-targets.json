These sketches by Catalan artist Ramón Casas (1866-1932) document the work of an under-represented artist who was influential in modernist art circles in Barcelona and Paris along with his peers John Singer Sargent, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and the young Pablo Picasso. Three bound hardcover volumes of sketches came to the Northwestern University Libraries in 1998 as part of a donation of books that had belonged to NU benefactor Charles Deering (1852-1927). Deering and Casas met in 1904 and established a lifelong friendship. At some point before the donation, a few hundred loose Casas drawings, postcards, and illustrated letters dating from 1891 to 1912 were bound into their current form. There were at least five volumes in the set; two remain in private collections.",
